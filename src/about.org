I'm currently a trainee Magnetic Resonance Physicist for NHS Wales working with =Python=, =Elisp=, =SQL= and big magnets.

Outwith employment, I dabble in many programming languages - mainly =Forth=, =Common Lisp=, =R=, =Fortran= and =Perl=.

In addition to turning coffee into bugs, I read a lot and bake bread.
