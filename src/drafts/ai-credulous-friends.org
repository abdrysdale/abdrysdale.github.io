/Note, this is a rebuttal to the article [[https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/][Thomas Ptacek's piece - My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts]]./

*Important Caveat:* As with the original article, I'm only discussing the implications of LLMs for software development.

Bona Fides: Most of my day-to-day work could be classed as data science - as applied to a national healthcare service. For my PhD, I developed novel neural network architectures from the ground up in uncharted domains. Most of my work involves using Python and SQL along with statistics in R, numerical simulations in Fortran and a lot of cobbled together stuff in elisp.
