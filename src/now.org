This is a [[https://sive.rs/now][now]] page.

Here's what I'm working on now:

- Twiddling my fingers whilst I wait for my PhD viva.
- I've been reading a lot - /I'm on track to read over 100 books this year with a few this year being over 1000 pages./
- Reading through the entirety of Python's standard library.
- But most importantly, spending time with my family.
