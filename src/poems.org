A collection of poems that have resonated with me on some level. Sorted by poet.

* Fletcher, John (1579-162)
** The River-God's Song

#+begin_example
Do not feat to they feet
Naked in the river sweet;
Think not leech or newt or toad
Will bite thy foot when thou hast trod;
Nor let the water rising high
As thou wad'st in make thee cry
And sob, but ever live with me,
And not a wave shall trouble thee.
#+end_example

* Thoreau, Henry David (1817-1862)
** I Was Born Upon Thy Bank, River

#+begin_example
I was born upon thy bank, river,
    My blood flows in thy stream,
And thou meanderest forever
    At the bottom of my dream
#+end_example
