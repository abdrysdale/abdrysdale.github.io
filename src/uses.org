* Footnotes

[fn:1] I previously used Gentoo but switched to Fedora due a bug I was having with external monitors not appearing after hibernation. This occurred late one night whilst writing my PhD thesis and I didn't have the time or mental energy to fix this so I decided to install Fedora. The bug persisted in Fedora and I've experienced a lot more bugs and crashes. As soon as I've got some spare time I will be switching back to Gentoo - it is far the most stable distro I've tried out of Ubuntu, Fedora, Manjaro, Arch, NixOS and Gentoo.

[fn:2] Unfortunately, I also have to use Windows for work.

[fn:3] I previously used Vim for around 5 years. The scope of what I'm able to do now far exceeds what I was previously able to do with Vim. Prior to Emacs, the thought of spending days tinkering with my editor's configuration file would have seemed impossible! Emacs feels like a snug room that I've built myself with everything just so. A little retreat from the stresses of the modern world. Vim just always felt like a tool.

[fn:4] Prior to Emacs, I used thunderbird for about a decade and had no complaints!

[fn:5] These are the languages that I consider myself fluent in and use for my day job.

[fn:6] These languages I use for hobby projects. I've written some decent projects in these but I'd need to build up some more experience and knowledge of best practices before I'd feel comfortable subjecting some future employee to a maintenance burden.

[fn:7] I suffer from a common Perl related vision problem whereby I can write Perl but I can't read it - not even my own.

[fn:8] These languages I've read a book or two about along with spending a lot of my day thinking about them. If I was given the green-light to do some work using one of these languages I'd ditch my tried and trusted languages in a heart-beat; and then most likely come crawling back, cap in hand, having realized I fallen into the trap of /"the grass is always greener"/.
