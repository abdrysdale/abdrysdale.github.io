* Footnotes

[fn:1] I previously used Gentoo but switched to Fedora due a bug I was having with external monitors not appearing after hibernation. This occurred late one night whilst writing my PhD thesis and I didn't have the time or mental energy to fix this so I decided to install Fedora. The bug persisted in Fedora and I've experienced a lot more bugs and crashes. As soon as I've got some spare time I will be switching back to Gentoo - it is far the most stable distro I've tried out of Ubuntu, Fedora, Manjaro, Arch, NixOS and Gentoo.

[fn:2] Unfortunately, I also have to use Windows for work.

[fn:3] I previously used Vim for around 5 years. The scope of what I'm able to do now far exceeds what I was previously able to do with Vim. Prior to Emacs, the thought of spending days tinkering with my editor's configuration file would have seemed impossible! Emacs feels like a snug room that I've built myself with everything just so. A little retreat from the stresses of the modern world. Vim just always felt like a tool.

[fn:4] Prior to Emacs, I used thunderbird for about a decade and had no complaints!

[fn:5] Python, R and Fortran are the only ones that I can really get stuff done. SQL and Perl I use when needed but I'm phasing out Perl in favour of Python for all of scripting and automation tasks. I have the most fun with Elisp, Forth and Common Lisp.
